# bikeSharing

##Purpose: 
Provide more data vizalizations for investors to demonstrate that a bike-sjaring program in Des Moines is a solid buisness proposal. In order to convice the stakeholders, show them the following:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
## Summary:
### Length of time that bikes are checked out by riders
From this visualization, we can see that all users stop riding the bikes by the first hour. We can also see most riders will stop riding after 10 minutes and then users drop exponentially thereafter.

### Length of time that bikes are checks by gender
From this visualization, we can see most riders idenify as male, followed by riders who identify as female, and last being unkown genders.
